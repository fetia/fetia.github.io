# Research Overview

My research focuses on the design of **intelligent and adaptive control architectures** for programmable networks.  
I study how artificial intelligence can enhance the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency of future communication infrastructures.  
The overarching goal is to achieve **automated, energy-efficient, and policy-aware orchestration** across multi-domain and multi-technology environments.

## Main Research Themes

- **AI-Driven Network Orchestration**  
  Leveraging reinforcement learning and graph-based intelligence for dynamic resource allocation, service placement, and network slicing.

- **Programmable and Distributed SDN**  
  Architectures for scalable, fault-tolerant, and consistent SDN control across geographically distributed domains.

- **Graph-Based Modeling and Optimization**  
  Applying graph theory and graph neural networks to represent network topologies and dependencies for optimization and prediction tasks.

- **Federated Multi-Agent Learning**  
  Coordination and decision-making among multiple controllers or agents under privacy and locality constraints.

- **Energy- and QoS-Aware Control**  
  Joint optimization of energy consumption and service quality in heterogeneous 5G/6G infrastructures.

## Methodology

My work combines:
- **Machine Learning** for adaptive and data-driven decision-making.  
- **Graph-Theoretic Modeling** for topology-aware reasoning and optimization.  
- **Simulation and Experimental Validation** on SDN/NFV testbeds for realistic performance evaluation.
