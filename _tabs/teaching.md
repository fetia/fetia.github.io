I teach and coordinate several courses at the  
[Ã‰cole Nationale SupÃ©rieure dâ€™Informatique pour lâ€™Industrie et lâ€™Entreprise (ENSIIE)](https://www.ensiie.fr),  
covering topics related to computer networks, distributed systems, and software infrastructures.  
My teaching emphasizes both theoretical foundations and hands-on experimentation through lab sessions and student projects.
